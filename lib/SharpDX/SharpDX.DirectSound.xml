            Description	
             DSCAPS_CERTIFIED	
            The driver has been tested and certified by Microsoft. This flag is always set for WDM drivers. To test for certification, use <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound.VerifyCertification(System.Int32@)"/>.	
             DSCAPS_CONTINUOUSRATE	
            The device supports all sample rates between the dwMinSecondarySampleRate and dwMaxSecondarySampleRate member values. Typically, this means that the actual output rate will be within +/- 10 hertz (Hz) of the requested frequency.	
             DSCAPS_EMULDRIVER	
            The device does not have a DirectSound driver installed, so it is being emulated through the waveform-audio functions. Performance degradation should be expected.	
             DSCAPS_PRIMARY16BIT	
            The device supports a primary buffer with 16-bit samples.	
             DSCAPS_PRIMARY8BIT	
            The device supports primary buffers with 8-bit samples.	
             DSCAPS_PRIMARYMONO	
            The device supports monophonic primary buffers.	
             DSCAPS_PRIMARYSTEREO	
            The device supports stereo primary buffers.	
             DSCAPS_SECONDARY16BIT	
            The device supports hardware-mixed secondary sound buffers with 16-bit samples.	
             DSCAPS_SECONDARY8BIT	
            The device supports hardware-mixed secondary buffers with 8-bit samples.	
             DSCAPS_SECONDARYMONO	
            The device supports hardware-mixed monophonic secondary buffers.	
             DSCAPS_SECONDARYSTEREO	
            The device supports hardware-mixed stereo secondary buffers.

ValueDescription DSSCL_EXCLUSIVEFor DirectX 8.0 and later, has the same effect as DSSCL_PRIORITY. For previous versions, sets the application to the exclusive level. This means that when it has the input focus, the application will be the only one audible; sounds from applications with the DSBCAPS_GLOBALFOCUS flag set will be muted. With this level, it also has all the privileges of the DSSCL_PRIORITY level. DirectSound will restore the hardware format, as specified by the most recent call to the {{SetFormat}} method, after the application gains the input focus. DSSCL_NORMALSets the normal level. This level has the smoothest multitasking and resource-sharing behavior, but because it does not allow the primary buffer format to change, output is restricted to the default 8-bit format. DSSCL_PRIORITYSets the priority level. Applications with this cooperative level can call the {{SetFormat}} and {{Compact}} methods. DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARYSets the write-primary level. The application has write access to the primary buffer. No secondary buffers can be played. This level cannot be set if the DirectSound driver is being emulated for the device; that is, if the {{GetCaps}} method returns the DSCAPS_EMULDRIVER flag in the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectSound.Capabilities"/> structure.  </param>

Voice allocation flags The voice allocation flags are valid only for buffers created with the DSBCAPS_LOCDEFER flag. One of the following flags can be used to force the processing of the sound into hardware or software. If neither DBSPLAY_LOCHARDWARE nor DBSPLAY_LOCSOFTWARE is set, the sound is played in either software or hardware, depending on the availability of resources at the time the method is called. See Remarks.  ValueDescription DSBPLAY_LOCHARDWAREPlay this voice in a hardware buffer only. If the hardware has no available voices and no voice management flags are set, the call to IDirectSoundBuffer8::Play fails. This flag cannot be combined with DSBPLAY_LOCSOFTWARE. DSBPLAY_LOCSOFTWAREPlay this voice in a software buffer only. This flag cannot be combined with DSBPLAY_LOCHARDWARE or any voice management flag.  Voice management flags The voice management flags are valid only for buffers created with the DSBCAPS_LOCDEFER flag, and are used for sounds that are to play in hardware. These flags enable hardware resources that are already in use to be yielded to the current sound. Only buffers created with the DSBCAPS_LOCDEFER flag are candidates for premature termination.

            <summary>	
            Flags that specify buffer-object capabilities. Use one or more of the values shown in the following table.  Value	
            Description	
             DSBCAPS_CTRL3D	
            The buffer has 3D control capability.	
             DSBCAPS_CTRLFREQUENCY	
            The buffer has frequency control capability.	
             DSBCAPS_CTRLFX	
            The buffer supports effects processing.	
             DSBCAPS_CTRLPAN	
            The buffer has pan control capability.	
             DSBCAPS_CTRLVOLUME	
            The buffer has volume control capability.	
             DSBCAPS_CTRLPOSITIONNOTIFY	
            The buffer has position notification capability. See the Remarks for <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectSound.CaptureBufferDescription"/>.	
             DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2	
            The buffer uses the new behavior of the play cursor when {{IDirectSoundBuffer8::GetCurrentPosition}} is called. In the first version of DirectSound, the play cursor was significantly ahead of the actual playing sound on emulated sound cards; it was directly behind the write cursor. Now, if the DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2 flag is specified, the application can get a more accurate play cursor. If this flag is not specified, the old behavior is preserved for compatibility. This flag affects only emulated devices; if a DirectSound driver is present, the play cursor is accurate for DirectSound in all versions of DirectX.	
             DSBCAPS_GLOBALFOCUS	
            The buffer is a global sound buffer. With this flag set, an application using DirectSound can continue to play its buffers if the user switches focus to another application, even if the new application uses DirectSound. The one exception is if you switch focus to a DirectSound application that uses the DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARY flag for its cooperative level. In this case, the global sounds from other applications will not be audible.	
             DSBCAPS_LOCDEFER	
            The buffer can be assigned to a hardware or software resource at play time, or when <see cref="M:SharpDX.DirectSound.SecondarySoundBuffer.AcquireResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32[])"/> is called.	
             DSBCAPS_LOCHARDWARE	
            The buffer uses hardware mixing.	
             DSBCAPS_LOCSOFTWARE	
            The buffer is in software memory and uses software mixing.	
             DSBCAPS_MUTE3DATMAXDISTANCE	
            The sound is reduced to silence at the maximum distance. The buffer will stop playing when the maximum distance is exceeded, so that processor time is not wasted. Applies only to software buffers.	
             DSBCAPS_PRIMARYBUFFER	
            The buffer is a primary buffer.	
             DSBCAPS_STATIC	
            The buffer is in on-board hardware memory.	
             DSBCAPS_STICKYFOCUS	
            The buffer has sticky focus. If the user switches to another application not using DirectSound, the buffer is still audible. However, if the user switches to another DirectSound application, the buffer is muted.	
             DSBCAPS_TRUEPLAYPOSITION	
            Force {{IDirectSoundBuffer8::GetCurrentPosition}} to return the buffer's true play position. This flag is only valid in Windows Vista.

            <summary>	
            The rate, in kilobytes per second, at which data is transferred to the buffer memory when {{IDirectSoundBuffer8::Unlock}} is called. High-performance applications can use this value to determine the time required for IDirectSoundBuffer8::Unlock to execute. For software buffers located in system memory, the rate will be very high because no processing is required. For hardware buffers, the rate might be slower because the buffer might have to be downloaded to the sound card, which might have a limited transfer rate.
