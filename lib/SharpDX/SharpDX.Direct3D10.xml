            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Resource priorities determine which resource to evict from video memory when the system has run out of video memory. The resource will not be lost; it will be removed from video memory and placed into system memory, or possibly placed onto the hard drive. The resource will be loaded back into video memory when it is required. A resource that is set to the maximum priority, DXGI_RESOURCE_PRIORITY_MAXIMUM, is only evicted if there is no other way of resolving the incoming memory request. The Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) tries to split an incoming memory request to its minimum size and evict lower-priority resources before evicting a resource with maximum priority. Changing the priorities of resources should be done carefully. The wrong eviction priorities could be a detriment to performance rather than an improvement. See {{QueryResourceResidency}} for additional information.

            For the CPU to write the contents of a resource, the resource must be created with the dynamic usage flag, D3D10_USAGE_DYNAMIC.  To both read and write those contents, the resource must be created with the staging usage flag, D3D10_USAGE_STAGING. (For more information about  these flags, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceUsage"/>.) ID3D10Buffer::Map will retrieve a reference to the resource data.  For a discussion on how to access resources efficiently, see {{Copying and Accessing Resource Data (Direct3D 10)}}. Call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Buffer.Unmap"/> to signify that the application has finished accessing the resource. ID3D10Buffer::Map has a few other restrictions. For example:  The same buffer cannot be mapped multiple times; in other words, do not call ID3D10Buffer::Map on a buffer that is already mapped. Any buffer that is bound to the pipeline must be unmapped before any rendering operation (that is, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.Draw(System.Int32,System.Int32)"/>)  can be executed.    Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 10: ID3D10Buffer::Map in Direct3D 10 is analogous to resource {{Lock}} in Direct3D 9.   ?

            <remarks>
            To share a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the resource must have been created with the  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared"/> flag, if it was created using the ID3D10Device interface.  If it was created using the IDXGIDevice interface, then the resource is always shared. The REFIID, or GUID, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(ID3D10Buffer) will get the GUID of the interface to a buffer resource. When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource"/> interface and then calling {{GetSharedHandle}}.
            <code> IDXGIResource* pOtherResource(NULL);
            hr = pOtherDeviceResource-&gt;QueryInterface( __uuidof(IDXGIResource), (void**)&amp;pOtherResource );
            HANDLE sharedHandle;
            pOtherResource-&gt;GetSharedHandle(&amp;sharedHandle); </code>
            The only resources that can be shared are 2D non-mipmapped textures. To share a resource between a Direct3D 9 device and a Direct3D 10 device the texture must have been created using  the pSharedHandle argument of {{CreateTexture}}.   The shared Direct3D 9 handle is then passed to OpenSharedResource in the hResource argument. The following code illustrates the method calls involved.
            <code> sharedHandle = NULL; // must be set to NULL to create, can use a valid handle here to open in D3D9
            pDevice9-&gt;CreateTexture(..., pTex2D_9, &amp;sharedHandle);
            ...
            pDevice10-&gt;OpenSharedResource(sharedHandle, __uuidof(ID3D10Resource), (void**)(&amp;tempResource10));
            tempResource10-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(ID3D10Texture2D), (void**)(&amp;pTex2D_10));
            tempResource10-&gt;Release();
            // now use pTex2D_10 with pDevice10    </code>
            Textures being shared from D3D9 to D3D10 have the following restrictions.  Textures must be 2D Only 1 mip level is allowed Texture must have default usage Texture must be write only MSAA textures are not allowed Bind flags must have SHADER_RESOURCE and RENDER_TARGET set Only R10G10B10A2_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_FLOAT and R8G8B8A8_UNORM formats are allowed  If a shared texture is updated on one device <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.Flush"/> must be called on that device.

For instance, the source and destination resources:  Must be different resources. Must be the same {{type}}. Must have identical dimensions (including width, height, depth, and size as appropriate). Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible {{formats}}, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. May not be currently {{mapped}}.   {{Immutable}}, and {{depth-stencil}} resources cannot be used as a destination.  Resources created with {{multisampling capability}} cannot be used as either a source or destination. The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. See {{performance considerations}} for more details. An application that only needs to copy a portion of the data in a resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D10.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D10.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceRegion})"/> instead.   Differences between Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1: Direct3D 10.1 enables depth-stencil resources to be used as either a source or destination. Direct3D 10.1 enables multisampled resources to be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if the source is multisampled and the destination is not multisampled (or vice versa), the call to ID3D10Device::CopyResource fails. It is possible to copy between prestructured+typed resources and block-compressed textures. See {{Format Conversion using Direct3D 10.1}}.   ?

            The predicate must be in the "issued" or "signaled" state to be used for predication.

This method is used to denote that subsequent rendering and resource manipulation commands are not actually performed if the resulting Predicate data of the Predicate is equal to the PredicateValue. However, some Predicates are only hints, so they may not actually prevent operations from being performed.  The primary usefulness of Predication is to allow an application to issue graphics commands without taking the performance hit of spinning, waiting for <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Asynchronous.GetData"/> to return. So, Predication can occur while ID3D10Asynchronous::GetData returns S_FALSE. Another way to think of it: an application can also use Predication as a fallback, if it is possible that ID3D10Asynchronous::GetData returns S_FALSE. If ID3D10Asynchronous::GetData returns S_OK, the application can skip calling the graphics commands manually with it's own application logic.

            <remarks>	
            A {{draw API}} submits work to the rendering pipeline. After data has been streamed out to {{SO stage}} buffers, those buffers can be again bound to the Input Assembler stage at input slot 0 and DrawAuto will draw them without the application needing to know the amount of data that was written to the buffers. A measurement of the amount of data written to the SO stage buffers is maintained internally when the data is streamed out. This means that the CPU does not need to fetch the measurement before re-binding the data that was streamed as input data. Although this amount is tracked internally, it is still the responsibility of applications to use input layouts to describe the format of the data in the SO stage buffers so that the layouts are available when the buffers are again bound to the input assembler. The following diagram shows the DrawAuto process.  ?  Diagram of DrawAuto as data moves through several stages to a buffer and then back to the Input Assembler stage ? Calling DrawAuto does not change the state of the streaming-output buffers that were bound again as inputs. DrawAuto only works when drawing with one input buffer bound as an input to the IA stage at slot 0. Applications must create the SO buffer resource with both binding flags, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.VertexBuffer"/> and D3D10_BIND_STREAM_OUTPUT. This API does not support indexing or instancing. If an application needs to retrieve the size of the streaming-output buffer, it can query for statistics on streaming output by using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D10.QueryType.StreamOutputStatistics"/>. Example of using DrawAuto can be found in the {{ParticlesGS Sample}} and {{PipesGS Sample}}.

            <remarks>	
            This method is unusual in that it causes the GPU to perform the copy operation (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a result, it has a few restrictions designed for improving performance. For instance, the source and destination resources:  Must be different resources. Must be the same {{type}}. Must have identical dimensions (including width, height, depth, and size as appropriate). Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible {{formats}}, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. May not be currently {{mapped}}.   {{Immutable}}, and {{depth-stencil}} resources cannot be used as a destination.  Resources created with {{multisampling capability}} cannot be used as either a source or destination. The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. See {{performance considerations}} for more details. An application that only needs to copy a portion of the data in a resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D10.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D10.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceRegion})"/> instead.   Differences between Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1: Direct3D 10.1 enables depth-stencil resources to be used as either a source or destination. Direct3D 10.1 enables multisampled resources to be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if the source is multisampled and the destination is not multisampled (or vice versa), the call to ID3D10Device::CopyResource fails. It is possible to copy between prestructured+typed resources and block-compressed textures. See {{Format Conversion using Direct3D 10.1}}.   ?

            <remarks>	
            For a shader-constant buffer; set pDstBox to NULL. It is not possible to use this method to partially update a shader-constant buffer. A resource cannot be used as a destination if:  the resource is created with {{immutable}} usage. the resource is created as a {{depth-stencil resource}}. the resource is created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/>).  When UpdateSubresource returns, the application is free to change or even free the data pointed to by pSrcData because the method has already copied/snapped away the original contents. The performance of UpdateSubresource depends on whether or not there is contention for the destination resource. For example, contention for a vertex buffer resource occurs when the application executes a Draw call and later calls UpdateSubresource on the same vertex buffer before the Draw call is actually executed by the GPU.  When there is contention for the resource, UpdateSubresource will perform 2 copies of the source data. First, the data is copied by the CPU to a temporary storage space accessible by the command buffer. This copy happens before the method returns.  A second copy is then performed by the GPU to copy the source data into non-mappable memory. This second copy happens asynchronously because it is executed by GPU when the command buffer is flushed. When there is no resource contention, the behavior of UpdateSubresource is dependent on which is faster (from the CPU's perspective): copying the data to the command buffer and then having a second copy execute when the command buffer is flushed, or having the CPU copy the data to the final resource location. This is dependent on the architecture of the underlying system.  To better understand the source row pitch and source depth pitch parameters, consider the following illustration of a 3D volume texture.  ?  Illustration of a 3D volume texture ? Each block in this visual represents an element of data, and the size of each element is dependent on the resource's format. For example, if the resource format is DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_FLOAT, then the size of each element would be 128 bits, or 16 bytes. This 3D volume texture has a width of two, a height of three, and a depth of four. To calculate the source row pitch and source depth pitch for a given resource, use the following formulas:  Source Row Pitch = [size of one element in bytes] * [number of elements in one row] Source Depth Pitch = [Source Row Pitch] * [number of rows (height)]  In the case of this example 3D volume texture where the size of each element is 16 bytes, the formulas are as follows:  Source Row Pitch = 16 * 2 = 32 Source Depth Pitch = 16 * 2 * 3 = 96  The following illustration shows the resource as it is laid out in memory.  ?  Illustration of a 3D volume texture in memory ? For example, the following code snippet shows how to specify a destination region in a 2D texture. Assume the destination texture is 512x512 and the operation will copy the data pointed to by pData to  [(120,100)..(200,220)] in the destination texture. Also assume that rowPitch has been initialized with the proper value (as explained above). Front and back are set to 0 and 1 respectively, because by having front equal to back, the box is technically empty. 	
            <code> D3D10_BOX destRegion;	
            destRegion.left = 120;	
            destRegion.right = 200;	
            destRegion.top = 100;	
            destRegion.bottom = 220;	
            destRegion.front = 0;	
            destRegion.back = 1; pd3dDevice-&gt;UpdateSubresource( pDestTexture, 0, &amp;destRegion, pData, rowPitch, 0 ); </code>	
            	
             The 1D case is similar. The following snippet shows how to specify a destination region in a 1D texture. Use the same assumptions as above, except that the texture is 512 in length. 	
            <code> D3D10_BOX destRegion;	
            destRegion.left = 120	
            destRegion.right = 200;

Whenever an error occurs, a Direct3D device enters the DEVICEREMOVED state and if the appropriate exception flag has been set, an exception is raised. A raised exception is designed to terminate an application. Before termination, the last chance an application has to persist data is by using an UnhandledExceptionFilter (see {{Structured Exception Handling}}). In general, UnhandledExceptionFilters are leveraged to try to persist data when an application is crashing (to disk, for example). Any code that executes during an UnhandledExceptionFilter is not guaranteed to reliably execute (due to possible process corruption). Any data that the UnhandledExceptionFilter manages to persist, before the UnhandledExceptionFilter crashes again, should be treated as suspect, and therefore inspected by a new, non-corrupted process to see if it is usable.

            Most applications will not need to call this method. Calling this method when not necessary will incur a performance penalty. Each call to Flush incurs a significant amount of overhead. When Direct3D state-setting, present, or draw commands are called by an application, those commands are queued into an internal command buffer. Flush sends those commands to the GPU for processing. Normally, these commands are sent to the GPU automatically whenever Direct3D determines that they need to be, such as when the command buffer is full or when mapping a resource. Flush will send the commands manually. Flush should be used when the CPU waits for an arbitrary amount of time (such as when calling {{Sleep}}, {{ID3DX10ThreadPump::WaitForAllItems}}, or {{WaitForVBlank}}. For more information about how flushing works, see {{Accurately Profiling Direct3D API Calls (Direct3D 9)}}.

            <remarks>	
            After creating an input layout object, it must be bound to the input-assembler stage before calling a draw API. See {{Getting Started with the Input-Assembler Stage (Direct3D 10)}} for example code. Once an input-layout object is created from a shader signature, the input-layout object can be reused with any other shader that has an identical input signature (semantics included). This can simplify the creation of input-layout objects when you are working with many shaders with identical inputs. If a data type in the input-layout declaration does not match the data type in a shader-input signature, CreateInputLayout will generate a warning during compilation. The warning is simply to call attention to the fact that the data may be reinterpreted when read from a register. You may either disregard this warning (if reinterpretation is intentional) or make the data types match in both declarations to eliminate the warning.  The {{Data Conversion Rules}} overview describes the rules applied for data type conversion.   Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 10: Mapping the vertex data to the shader inputs with an input layout is a new way of doing things in Direct3D 10 that improves performance. In Direct3D 10 the vertex data is mapped to the shader inputs when the input layout object is created, whereas in Direct3D 9 this mapping was done at Draw time based on the currently bound vertex declarations, vertex buffers, and vertex shaders. Doing this mapping when the input layout object is created reduces or eliminates extra linkage work for drivers at Draw time because this re-mapping is no longer necessary.   ?

            <remarks>	
            When multisampling a texture, the number of quality levels available for an adapter is dependent on the texture format used and the number of samples requested. The maximum sample count defined by D3D10_MAX_MULTISAMPLE_SAMPLE_COUNT in d3d10.h is 32. If the returned value of pNumQualityLevels is 0, the format and sample count combination is not supported for the installed adapter. Furthermore, the definition of a quality level is up to each hardware vendor to define, however no facility is provided by Direct3D to help discover  this information. Direct3D 10.1 devices are required to support 4x MSAA for all formats except R32G32B32A32 and R32G32B32 formats.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            To share a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the resource must have been created with the  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared"/> flag, if it was created using the ID3D10Device interface.  If it was created using the IDXGIDevice interface, then the resource is always shared. The REFIID, or GUID, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(ID3D10Buffer) will get the GUID of the interface to a buffer resource. When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource"/> interface and then calling {{GetSharedHandle}}. 	
            <code> IDXGIResource* pOtherResource(NULL);	
            hr = pOtherDeviceResource-&gt;QueryInterface( __uuidof(IDXGIResource), (void**)&amp;pOtherResource );	
            HANDLE sharedHandle;	
            pOtherResource-&gt;GetSharedHandle(&amp;sharedHandle); </code>	
            	
             The only resources that can be shared are 2D non-mipmapped textures. To share a resource between a Direct3D 9 device and a Direct3D 10 device the texture must have been created using  the pSharedHandle argument of {{CreateTexture}}.   The shared Direct3D 9 handle is then passed to OpenSharedResource in the hResource argument. The following code illustrates the method calls involved. 	
            <code> sharedHandle = NULL; // must be set to NULL to create, can use a valid handle here to open in D3D9 	
            pDevice9-&gt;CreateTexture(..., pTex2D_9, &amp;sharedHandle); 	
            ... 	
            pDevice10-&gt;OpenSharedResource(sharedHandle, __uuidof(ID3D10Resource), (void**)(&amp;tempResource10)); 	
            tempResource10-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(ID3D10Texture2D), (void**)(&amp;pTex2D_10)); 	
            tempResource10-&gt;Release(); 	
            // now use pTex2D_10 with pDevice10    </code>	
            	
             Textures being shared from D3D9 to D3D10 have the following restrictions.  Textures must be 2D Only 1 mip level is allowed Texture must have default usage Texture must be write only MSAA textures are not allowed Bind flags must have SHADER_RESOURCE and RENDER_TARGET set Only R10G10B10A2_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_FLOAT and R8G8B8A8_UNORM formats are allowed  If a shared texture is updated on one device <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.Flush"/> must be called on that device.

            A call to OMSetRenderTargets overrides all bounded render targets and the depth stencil target regardless of the number of render targets in ppRenderTargetViews. The maximum number of render targets a device can have active at any given time is set by a #define in D3D10.h called D3D10_SIMULTANEOUS_RENDER_TARGET_COUNT. It is invalid to try to set the same {{subresource}} to multiple render target slots. If any subresources are also currently bound for reading or writing (perhaps in a different part of the {{pipeline}}), those bind points will be NULL'ed out to prevent the same subresource from being read and written simultaneously in a single rendering operation. The method will not hold references to the interfaces passed in. For that reason, applications should be careful not to release interfaces currently in use by the device. See {{Binding Resources and Pipeline stages}} for more information on binding resources.

            <remarks>	
            Blend state is used by the {{output-merger}} stage to determine how to blend together two pixel values. The two values are commonly the current pixel value and the pixel value already in the output render target. Use the {{blend operation}} to control where the two pixel values come from and how they are mathematically combined. To create a blend-state interface, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.CreateBlendState(SharpDX.Direct3D10.BlendStateDescription@,SharpDX.Direct3D10.BlendState@)"/>. Passing in NULL for the blend-state interface indicates to the runtime to set a default blending state.  The following table indicates the default blending parameters.  StateDefault Value AlphaToCoverageEnableFALSE BlendEnableFALSE[8] SrcBlendD3D10_BLEND_ONE DstBlendD3D10_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpD3D10_BLEND_OP_ADD SrcBlendAlphaD3D10_BLEND_ONE DstBlendAlphaD3D10_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpAlphaD3D10_BLEND_OP_ADD RenderTargetWriteMask[8]D3D10_COLOR_WRITE_ENABLE_ALL[8]  ? A sample mask determines which samples get updated in all the active render targets. The mapping of bits in a sample mask to samples in a multisample render target is the responsibility of an individual application. A sample mask is always applied; it is independent of whether multisampling is enabled, and does not depend on whether an application uses multisample render targets.

            A resource is made up of one or more {{subresources}}, a view identifies which subresources to allow the pipeline to access. In addition, each resource is bound to the pipeline using a view. A shader-resource view is designed to bind any buffer or texture resource to the {{shader stages}} using the following API methods: {{VSSetShaderResources}}, {{GSSetShaderResources}} and {{PSSetShaderResources}}. Since a view is fully typed, this means that typeless resources become fully typed when bound to the pipeline. This method requires Windows Vista Service Pack 1.

            An application can create up to 4096 unique blend-state objects. For each object created, the runtime checks to see if a previous object has the same state.

            <remarks>	
            An effect uses memory space two different ways: to store the information required by the runtime to execute an effect, and to store the metadata  required to reflect information back to an application using the API. You can minimize the amount of memory required by an effect by  calling ID3D10Effect::Optimize which removes the reflection metadata from memory. API methods to read variables will no  longer work once reflection data has been removed. The following methods will fail after Optimize has been called on an effect.   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Effect.GetConstantBufferByIndex(System.Int32)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Effect.GetConstantBufferByName(System.String)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Effect.GetDescription(SharpDX.Direct3D10.EffectDescription@)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Effect.GetDevice(SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device@)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Effect.GetTechniqueByIndex(System.Int32)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Effect.GetTechniqueByName(System.String)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Effect.GetVariableByIndex(System.Int32)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Effect.GetVariableByName(System.String)"/>   <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Effect.GetVariableBySemantic(System.String)"/>   Note that references retrieved with these methods before calling ID3D10Effect::Optimize are still valid  after ID3D10Effect::Optimize is called.  This allows the application to get all the variables, techniques, and passes it will use,  call Optimize, and then use the effect.

            The parameters of this method are very similar to those of the {{GDI DrawText}} function. This method supports both ANSI and Unicode strings. Unless the DT_NOCLIP format is used, this method clips the text so that it does not appear outside the specified rectangle. All formatting is assumed to have multiple lines unless the DT_SINGLELINE format is specified. If the selected font is too large for the rectangle, this method does not attempt to substitute a smaller font. This method supports only fonts whose escapement and orientation are both zero.

As with any RECT object, the coordinate value of the rectangle's right side must be greater than that of its left side. Likewise, the coordinate value of the bottom must be greater than that of the top. </param>
            <param name="drawFlags">Specify the method of formatting the text. It can be any combination of the following values:    ItemDescription  DT_BOTTOM  Justify the text to the bottom of the rectangle. This value must be combined with DT_SINGLELINE.   DT_CALCRECT  Tell DrawText to automatically calculate the width and height of the rectangle based on the length of the string you tell it to draw. If there are multiple lines of text, ID3DX10Font::DrawText uses the width of the rectangle pointed to by the pRect parameter and extends the base of the rectangle to bound the last line of text. If there is only one line of text, ID3DX10Font::DrawText modifies the right side of the rectangle so that it bounds the last character in the line. In either case, ID3DX10Font::DrawText returns the height of the formatted text but does not draw the text.   DT_CENTER  Center text horizontally in the rectangle.   DT_EXPANDTABS  Expand tab characters. The default number of characters per tab is eight.   DT_LEFT  Align text to the left.   DT_NOCLIP  Draw without clipping. ID3DX10Font::DrawText is somewhat faster when DT_NOCLIP is used.   DT_RIGHT  Align text to the right.   DT_RTLREADING  Display text in right-to-left reading order for bidirectional text when a Hebrew or Arabic font is selected. The default reading order for all text is left-to-right.   DT_SINGLELINE  Display text on a single line only. Carriage returns and line feeds do not break the line.   DT_TOP  Top-justify text.   DT_VCENTER  Center text vertically (single line only).   DT_WORDBREAK  Break words. Lines are automatically broken between words if a word would extend past the edge of the rectangle specified by the pRect parameter. A carriage return/line feed sequence also breaks the line.   ? </param>

            <returns>If the function succeeds, the return value is the height of the text in logical units. If DT_VCENTER or DT_BOTTOM is specified, the return value is the offset from pRect (top to the bottom) of the drawn text. If the function fails, the return value is zero. </returns>

It can be any combination of the following values:    ItemDescription  DT_BOTTOM  Justify the text to the bottom of the rectangle. This value must be combined with DT_SINGLELINE.   DT_CALCRECT  Tell DrawText to automatically calculate the width and height of the rectangle based on the length of the string you tell it to draw. If there are multiple lines of text, ID3DX10Font::DrawText uses the width of the rectangle pointed to by the pRect parameter and extends the base of the rectangle to bound the last line of text. If there is only one line of text, ID3DX10Font::DrawText modifies the right side of the rectangle so that it bounds the last character in the line. In either case, ID3DX10Font::DrawText returns the height of the formatted text but does not draw the text.   DT_CENTER  Center text horizontally in the rectangle.   DT_EXPANDTABS  Expand tab characters. The default number of characters per tab is eight.   DT_LEFT  Align text to the left.   DT_NOCLIP  Draw without clipping. ID3DX10Font::DrawText is somewhat faster when DT_NOCLIP is used.   DT_RIGHT  Align text to the right.   DT_RTLREADING  Display text in right-to-left reading order for bidirectional text when a Hebrew or Arabic font is selected. The default reading order for all text is left-to-right.   DT_SINGLELINE  Display text on a single line only. Carriage returns and line feeds do not break the line.   DT_TOP  Top-justify text.   DT_VCENTER  Center text vertically (single line only).   DT_WORDBREAK  Break words. Lines are automatically broken between words if a word would extend past the edge of the rectangle specified by the pRect parameter. A carriage return/line feed sequence also breaks the line.   ? </param>
            <param name="color">Color of the text. See <see cref="T:SharpDX.Color4"/>. </param>
            <returns>If the function succeeds, the return value is the height of the text in logical units. If DT_VCENTER or DT_BOTTOM is specified, the return value is the offset from pRect (top to the bottom) of the drawn text. If the function fails, the return value is zero. </returns>

            <remarks>	
            An application identifies the way a resource is intended to be used (its usage) in a resource description. There are several structures for creating resources including: <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Texture1DDescription"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Texture2DDescription"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Texture3DDescription"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BufferDescription"/>, and <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ImageLoadInformation"/>.   Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 10: In Direct3D 9, you specify the type of memory a resource should be created in at resource creation time (using D3DPOOL). It was an application's job to decide what memory pool would provide the best combination of functionality and performance. In Direct3D 10, an application no longer specifies what type of memory (the pool) to create a resource in. Instead, you specify the intended usage of the resource, and let the runtime (in concert with the driver and a memory manager) choose the type of memory that will achieve the best performance.   ? Resource Usage Restrictions Each usage dictates a tradeoff between functionality and performance. In general, resource accessing is accomplished with the following APIs.  CPU access is done with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Buffer.Map(SharpDX.Direct3D10.MapMode)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Texture1D.Map(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D10.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D10.MapFlags,System.IntPtr@)"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Texture2D.Map(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D10.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D10.MapFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D10.MappedTexture2D@)"/>, or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Texture3D.Map(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D10.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D10.MapFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D10.MappedTexture3D@)"/>  GPU access is done with {{CopySubresourceRegion}}, {{CopyResource}}, or {{UpdateSubresource}}.  Use the following table to choose the usage that best describes how the resource will need to be accessed by the CPU and/or the GPU. Of course, there will be performance tradeoffs.  Resource UsageDefaultDynamicImmutableStaging GPU-Readyesyes1yesyes1, 2 GPU-Writeyes1yes1, 2 CPU-Readyes1, 2 CPU-Writeyesyes1, 2  ?  1 - This is restricted to {{CopySubresourceRegion}} and {{CopyResource}}. 2 - Cannot be a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled render target.  Resource Bind Options To maximize performance, not all resource usage options can be used as input or output resources to the pipeline. This table identifies these limitations.  Resource Can Be Bound AsDefaultDynamicImmutableStaging Input to a Stageyes3yes4yes Output from a Stageyes3  ?  3 - If bound as an input and an output using different views, each view must use different {{subresources}}. 4 - The resource can only be created with a single {{subresource}}.

            In general, binding flags can be combined using a logical OR (except the constant-buffer flag); however, you should use a single flag to allow the device to optimize the resource usage. This enumeration is used by a:   {{Buffer description}} when creating a buffer.

A shader-resource buffer is NOT a constant buffer; rather, it is a texture or buffer resource that is bound to a shader, that contains texture or buffer data (it is not limited to a single element type in the buffer). A shader-resource buffer is created with the D3D10_BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE flag and is bound to the pipeline using one of these APIs: <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.GeometryShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D10.ShaderResourceView[])"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.PixelShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D10.ShaderResourceView[])"/>, or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.VertexShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D10.ShaderResourceView[])"/>.

These remarks are divided into the following topics:   {{Meaning of D3D10_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE}} {{Common Usage of D3D10_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD with D3D10_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE}}  Meaning of D3D10_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE D3D10_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE signifies that the application promises not to write to data that the {{Input Assembler}} (IA) stage is using. In exchange, the GPU allows the application to write to other parts of the same buffer.  The application must ensure that it does not write over any data in use by the IA stage. For example, consider the buffer illustrated in the following diagram. If a Draw call has been issued that uses vertices 4-6, an application that calls Map on this buffer must ensure that it does not write to the vertices that the Draw call will access during rendering. ?  Diagram of vertex data in different stages of utilization ? However, ensuring this can be difficult, because the GPU is often many frames behind the CPU in terms of which frame it is currently processing. Keeping track of which sections of a resource are being used because of calls made 2 to 5 frames ago is difficult and error-prone. Because of this, it is recommended that applications only write to the uninitialized portions of a resource when using D3D10_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE. Common Usage of D3D10_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD with D3D10_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE D3D10_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD and D3D10_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE are normally used in conjunction with dynamic index/vertex buffers, although they can also be used with dynamic textures. A common use of these two flags involves filling dynamic index/vertex buffers with geometry that can be seen from the camera's current position. The first time that data is entered into the buffer on a given frame, Map is called with D3D10_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD; doing so invalidates the previous contents of the buffer. The buffer is then filled with all available data. Subsequent writes to the buffer within the same frame should use D3D10_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE. This will enable the CPU to access a resource that is potentially being used by the GPU as long as the restrictions described previously are respected.

            Filtering options during texture sampling.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            During texture sampling, one or more texels are read and combined (this is calling filtering) to produce a single value. Point sampling reads a single texel while linear sampling reads two texels (endpoints) and linearly interpolates a third value between the endpoints. HLSL texture-sampling functions also support comparison filtering during texture sampling. Comparison filtering compares each sampled texel against a comparison value. The boolean result is blended the same way that normal texture filtering is blended. You can use HLSL intrinsic texture-sampling functions that implement texture filtering only or companion functions that use texture filtering with comparison filtering.  Texture Sampling FunctionTexture Sampling Function with Comparison Filtering  {{sample}}  {{samplecmp}} or {{samplecmplevelzero}}   ? Comparison filters only work with textures that have the following {{formats}}: R32_FLOAT_X8X24_TYPELESS, R32_FLOAT, R24_UNORM_X8_TYPELESS, R16_UNORM.

An application might dynamically create (and destroy) threads to improve performance especially on a machine with multiple CPU cores.  There may be cases, however, when an application needs to prevent extra threads from being created. This can happen when you want to simplify  debugging, profile code or develop a tool for instance. For these cases, use D3D10_CREATE_DEVICE_PREVENT_INTERNAL_THREADING_OPTIMIZATIONS to request  that the runtime and video driver not create any additional threads that might interfere with the application.

            D3DX10 automatically performs gamma correction (to convert color data from RGB space to standard RGB space) when loading texture data. This is automatically done for instance when RGB data is loaded from a .png file into an sRGB texture. Use the SRGB filter flags to indicate if the data does not need to be converted into sRGB space.

            A state block is a collection of device state, and is used for saving and restoring device state. Use a state-block mask to enable subsets of state for saving and restoring. The <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.StateBlockMask"/> structure can be filled manually or by using any of the D3D10StateBlockMaskXXX APIs. A state block mask can also be obtained by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.EffectTechnique.ComputeStateBlockMask(SharpDX.Direct3D10.StateBlockMask@)"/> or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.EffectPass.ComputeStateBlockMask(SharpDX.Direct3D10.StateBlockMask@)"/>.   Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 10: In Direct3D 10, a state block object does not contain any valid information about the state of the device until <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.StateBlock.Capture"/> is called. In Direct3D 9, state is saved in a state block object, when it is created.   ?

            Get a reference to the data contained in a subresource, and deny the GPU access to that subresource.

            <remarks>	
            Mapping a texture enables the CPU to directly access the underlying data in the subresource of a texture. For the method to succeed, the texture being mapped must be created with the appropriate flags (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.CpuAccessFlags"/>), and its specified usage (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceUsage"/>) must be either D3D10_USAGE_DYNAMIC or D3D10_USAGE_STAGING. Common failures of Map methods are indicated by the following return values:   ItemDescription  DXGI_ERROR_WAS_STILL_DRAWING  If MapFlags specifies D3D10_MAP_FLAG_DO_NOT_WAIT and the GPU is not yet finished with the resource, Map returns DXGI_ERROR_WAS_STILL_DRAWING.   DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED  Map returns DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED if MapType allows any CPU read access and the video card has been removed.   ? For more information about the preceding return values, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.DXGIError"/>. Map has the following restrictions:  A single subresource cannot be mapped multiple times; in other words, do not call Map on a subresource that is already mapped. Any subresource that is bound to the pipeline must be unmapped before any render operation (that is, before <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.Draw(System.Int32,System.Int32)"/>) can be executed.  Applications must cast the void pData reference to the appropriate type to meaningfully access the underlying subresource data. For example, the following code demonstrates how to read each texel of a 1D subresource. It is assumed that the texture was created using <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32A32_Float"/> and that pData is the reference to the texture resource data output from a successful call to this method. 	
            <code> FLOAT* pTexels = (FLOAT*)pData;	
            for( UINT col = 0; col &lt; width; col++ )	
            { pTexels[col*4 + 0]; // Alpha pTexels[col*4 + 1]; // Blue pTexels[col*4 + 2]; // Green pTexels[col*4 + 3]; // Red	
            } </code>

            A hardware device is commonly referred to as a HAL device, which stands for a hardware accelerated device. This means that the pipeline is rendering all of the pipeline commands in hardware, using the GPU. Operating the pipeline with a HAL device gives the best performance generally, but it can be more difficult to debug since resources exist on the GPU instead of the CPU. A software device implements rendering in software using the CPU with no hardware acceleration. A software device is commonly referred to as a reference device or REF device. Because a REF device implements rendering on the CPU, it is generally slower, but is easier to debug since it allows access to resources.

            After an application generates adjacency information for a mesh, the mesh data can be optimized for better drawing performance.

This function returns the resulting point by using the following equation: V1 + U(V2 - V1) + V(V3 - V1). Any point in the plane V1V2V3 can be represented by the barycentric coordinate (U,V).

In this context, using barycentric coordinates represents a change in coordinate systems. What holds true for Cartesian coordinates holds true for barycentric coordinates.

            Commit any changes made to a mesh to the device so that the changes can be rendered. This should be called after a mesh's data is altered and before it is rendered. A mesh cannot be rendered unless it is committed to the device. See remarks.

            <remarks>	
            When a mesh is loaded, it's data is loaded into staging resources, meaning the data can be altered but not rendered. When CommitToDevice is called, the data from the staging resources are copied into device resources so that they can be rendered. Although the data is committed to the device, the staging resources remain and can be modified. If any modifications are made to the staging resources, the staging resources must be committed to the device again in order for those changes to be rendered on screen.

            <remarks>	
            An attribute table is used to identify areas of the mesh that need to be drawn with different textures, render states, materials, and so on. In addition, the application can use the attribute table to hide portions of a mesh by not drawing a given attribute identifier (AttribId) when drawing the frame.

            Draw several instances of the same subset of a mesh.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A mesh contains an attribute table. The attribute table can divide a mesh into subsets, where each subset is identified with an attribute ID.  For example, a mesh with 200 faces, divided into three subsets, might have an attribute table that looks like this:  AttribID 0Faces 0 ~ 50 AttribID 1Faces 51 ~ 125 AttribID 2Faces 126 ~ 200  ? Instancing may extend performance by reusing the same geometry to draw multiple objects in a scene.  One example of instancing could be to draw the same object with different positions and colors.  Indexing requires multiple vertex buffers: at least one for per-vertex data and a second buffer for per-instance data. Drawing instances with DrawSubsetInstanced is very similar to the process used with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.DrawIndexedInstanced(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32)"/> that is outlined  in {{Instancing Sample}}.  The key difference when using DrawSubsetInstanced is that vertex and index buffers must be extracted  from the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Mesh"/> object before the instancing data can be combined. The following code illustrates extracting the vertex and index buffers from the mesh object. 	
            <code> ID3D10Buffer* vertexBuffer; pDeviceObj-&gt;pMesh-&gt;GetDeviceVertexBuffer(0, &amp;vertexBuffer); ID3D10Buffer* indexBuffer; pDeviceObj-&gt;pMesh-&gt;GetDeviceIndexBuffer(&amp;indexBuffer); </code>

            This method generates a new mesh.

The adjacency buffer contains adjacency data, such as a list of edges and the faces that are adjacent to each other. This method is very similar to the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Mesh.CloneMesh(System.Int32,System.String,SharpDX.Direct3D10.InputElement[],System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D10.Mesh@)"/> method, except that it can perform optimization while generating the new clone of the mesh.

If the resource being created does not require a system-memory pitch or a system-memory-pitch slice, then you are free to use those members to  pass size information which may help you when debugging a problem creating a resource. Note that an application should not rely on SysMemPitch being exactly equal to the number of texels in a line times the size of a texel. In some cases SysMemPitch will include padding to skip past additional data in a line.  This could be padding for alignment or  the texture could be a subsection of a larger texture.  For example the D3D10_SUBRESOURCE_DATA structure could represent a 32 by 32 subsection of a 128 by 128 texture.   The value for SysMemSlicePitch will reflect any padding included in SysMemPitch.

However, the actual layout of each element in memory looks more like the following illustration.  ?  Illustration of the row pitch in memory ? For this example, the row pitch encompasses 5 elements (one row), whose size would be five times the number of bytes per element. Use row pitch to advance a reference between rows within a single 2D texture plane.

            <remarks>	
            A view is a format-specific way to look at the data in a resource. The view determines what data to look at, and how it is cast when read. For more information about how views work, see {{Views}}  When viewing a resource, the resource-view description must specify a typed format, that is compatible with the resource format. So that means that you cannot create a resource-view description using any format with _TYPELESS in the name. You can however view a typeless resource by specifying a typed format for the view. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS resource can be viewed with one of these typed formats: DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT, DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT, and DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_SINT, since these typed formats are compatible with the typeless resource. Create a shader-resource-view description by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.CreateShaderResourceView(SharpDX.Direct3D10.Resource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D10.ShaderResourceViewDescription},SharpDX.Direct3D10.ShaderResourceView@)"/>.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A shader can take n inputs and can produce m outputs. The order of the input (or output) parameters, their associated types, and any attached semantics make up the shader signature. Each shader has an input and an output signature. When compiling a shader or an effect, some API calls validate shader signatures (such as {{D3D10CompileShader}} and {{D3D10CompileEffectFromMemory}}). That is, they compare the output signature of one shader (like a vertex shader) with the input signature of another shader (like a pixel shader). This ensures that a shader outputs data that is compatible with a downstream shader that is consuming that data. Compatible means that a shader signature is a exact-match subset of the preceding shader stage. Exact match means parameter types and semantics must exactly match. Subset means that a parameter that is not required by a downstream stage, does not need to include that parameter in its shader signature. Get a shader-signature from a shader or an effect by calling APIs such as {{ID3D10ShaderReflection::GetInputParameterDesc}} or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.EffectShaderVariable.GetInputSignatureElementDescription(System.Int32,System.Int32)"/>.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A view is a format-specific way to look at the data in a resource. The view determines what data to look at, and how it is cast when read. For more information about how views work, see {{Views}}  When viewing a resource, the resource-view description must specify a typed format, that is compatible with the resource format. So that means that you cannot create a resource-view description using any format with _TYPELESS in the name. You can however view a typeless resource by specifying a typed format for the view. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS resource can be viewed with one of these typed formats: DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT, DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT, and DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_SINT, since these typed formats are compatible with the typeless resource. Create a shader-resource-view description by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device1.CreateShaderResourceView1(SharpDX.Direct3D10.Resource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D10.ShaderResourceViewDescription1},SharpDX.Direct3D10.ShaderResourceView1@)"/>. To view a shader-resource-view description, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ShaderResourceView.GetDescription(SharpDX.Direct3D10.ShaderResourceViewDescription@)"/>. This structure requires Windows Vista Service Pack 1.

            This structure describes how a simplification operation will consider vertex data when calculating relative costs between collapsing edges. For example, if the Normal field is 0.0, the simplification operation will ignore the vertex normal component when calculating the error for the collapse. However, if the Normal field is 1.0, the simplification operation will use the vertex normal component. If the Normal field is 2.0, double the amount of errors; if the Normal field is 4.0, then quadruple the number of errors, and so on.
