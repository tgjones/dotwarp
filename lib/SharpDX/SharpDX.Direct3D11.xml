            The data stored in the device child with this method can be retrieved with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceChild.GetPrivateData(System.Guid,System.Int32@,System.IntPtr)"/>. The {{debug layer}} reports memory leaks by outputting a list of object interface references along with their friendly names. The default friendly name is "&lt;unnamed&gt;". You can set the friendly name so that you can determine if the corresponding object interface reference caused the leak. To set the friendly name, use the SetPrivateData method and the WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName GUID that is in D3Dcommon.h. For example, to give pContext a friendly name of My name, use the following code: 	
            <code> static const char c_szName[] = "My name";	
            hr = pContext-&gt;SetPrivateData( WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName, sizeof( c_szName ) - 1, c_szName ); </code>

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Resource priorities determine which resource to evict from video memory when the system has run out of video memory. The resource will not be lost; it will be removed from video memory and placed into system memory, or possibly placed onto the hard drive. The resource will be loaded back into video memory when it is required. A resource that is set to the maximum priority, DXGI_RESOURCE_PRIORITY_MAXIMUM, is only evicted if there is no other way of resolving the incoming memory request. The Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) tries to split an incoming memory request to its minimum size and evict lower-priority resources before evicting a resource with maximum priority. Changing the priorities of resources should be done carefully. The wrong eviction priorities could be a detriment to performance rather than an improvement.

An instance is not restricted to being used for a single type in a single shader. An instance is flexible and can be used for any shader that used the same type name or instance name when the instance was generated.  A created instance will work for any shader that contains a type of the same type name. For instance, a class instance created with the type name DefaultShader would work in any shader that contained a type DefaultShader even though several shaders could describe a different type. A gotten instance maps directly to an instance name/index in a shader.  A class instance aquired using GetClassInstance will work for any shader that contains a class instance of the name used to generate the runtime instance, the instance does not have to be the same type in all of the shaders it's used in.  An instance does not replace the importance of reflection for a particular shader since a gotten instance will not know its slot location and a created instance only specifies a type name.

            To share a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the resource must have been created with the  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared"/> flag, if it was created using the ID3D10Device interface.  If it was created using the IDXGIDevice interface, then the resource is always shared. The REFIID, or GUID, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(ID3D10Buffer) will get the GUID of the interface to a buffer resource. When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource"/> interface and then calling {{GetSharedHandle}}.
            <code> IDXGIResource* pOtherResource(NULL);
            hr = pOtherDeviceResource-&gt;QueryInterface( __uuidof(IDXGIResource), (void**)&amp;pOtherResource );
            HANDLE sharedHandle;
            pOtherResource-&gt;GetSharedHandle(&amp;sharedHandle); </code>
            The only resources that can be shared are 2D non-mipmapped textures. To share a resource between a Direct3D 9 device and a Direct3D 10 device the texture must have been created using  the pSharedHandle argument of {{CreateTexture}}.   The shared Direct3D 9 handle is then passed to OpenSharedResource in the hResource argument. The following code illustrates the method calls involved.
            <code> sharedHandle = NULL; // must be set to NULL to create, can use a valid handle here to open in D3D9
            pDevice9-&gt;CreateTexture(..., pTex2D_9, &amp;sharedHandle);
            ...
            pDevice10-&gt;OpenSharedResource(sharedHandle, __uuidof(ID3D10Resource), (void**)(&amp;tempResource10));
            tempResource10-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(ID3D10Texture2D), (void**)(&amp;pTex2D_10));
            tempResource10-&gt;Release();
            // now use pTex2D_10 with pDevice10    </code>
            Textures being shared from D3D9 to D3D10 have the following restrictions.  Textures must be 2D Only 1 mip level is allowed Texture must have default usage Texture must be write only MSAA textures are not allowed Bind flags must have SHADER_RESOURCE and RENDER_TARGET set Only R10G10B10A2_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_FLOAT and R8G8B8A8_UNORM formats are allowed  If a shared texture is updated on one device <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Flush"/> must be called on that device.

            A resource is made up of one or more subresources, a view identifies which subresources to allow the pipeline to access. In addition, each resource is bound to the pipeline using a view. A shader-resource view is designed to bind any buffer or texture resource to the shader stages using the following  API methods: <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.VertexShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView[])"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GeometryShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView[])"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.PixelShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView[])"/>.

            <remarks>	
            After creating an input layout object, it must be bound to the input-assembler stage before calling a draw API. Once an input-layout object is created from a shader signature, the input-layout object can be reused with any other shader that has an identical input signature (semantics included). This can simplify the creation of input-layout objects when you are working with many shaders with identical inputs. If a data type in the input-layout declaration does not match the data type in a shader-input signature, CreateInputLayout will generate a warning during compilation. The warning is simply to call attention to the fact that the data may be reinterpreted when read from a register. You may either disregard this warning (if reinterpretation is intentional) or make the data types match in both declarations to eliminate the warning.

            <remarks>	
            A deferred context is a thread-safe context that you can use to record graphics commands on a thread other than the main rendering thread.  Using a deferred context, you can record graphics commands into a command list that is encapsulated by the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CommandList"/> interface.  After all scene items are recorded, you can then submit them to the main render thread for final rendering.  In this manner, you can perform rendering tasks concurrently across multiple threads and potentially improve performance in multi-core CPU scenarios. You can create multiple deferred contexts. Note??If you use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags.SingleThreaded"/> value to create the device that is represented by <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>, the CreateDeferredContext method will fail, and you will not be able to create a deferred context.

            <summary>	
            Give a device access to a shared resource created on a different device.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The REFIID, or GUID, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro. For example, __uuidof(ID3D11Buffer) will get the GUID of the interface to a buffer resource. The unique handle of the resource is obtained differently depending on the type of device that originally created the resource. To share a resource between two Direct3D 11 devices the resource must have been created with the  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared"/> flag, if it was created using the ID3D11Device interface.  If it was created using a DXGI device interface, then the resource is always shared. The REFIID, or GUID, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(ID3D11Buffer) will get the GUID of the interface to a buffer resource. When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10/11 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource"/> interface and then calling {{GetSharedHandle}}. 	
            <code> IDXGIResource* pOtherResource(NULL);	
            hr = pOtherDeviceResource-&gt;QueryInterface( __uuidof(IDXGIResource), (void**)&amp;pOtherResource );	
            HANDLE sharedHandle;	
            pOtherResource-&gt;GetSharedHandle(&amp;sharedHandle); </code>	
            	
             The only resources that can be shared are 2D non-mipmapped textures. To share a resource between a Direct3D 9 device and a Direct3D 11 device the texture must have been created using  the pSharedHandle argument of {{CreateTexture}}.   The shared Direct3D 9 handle is then passed to OpenSharedResource in the hResource argument. The following code illustrates the method calls involved. 	
            <code> sharedHandle = NULL; // must be set to NULL to create, can use a valid handle here to open in D3D9 	
            pDevice9-&gt;CreateTexture(..., pTex2D_9, &amp;sharedHandle); 	
            ... 	
            pDevice11-&gt;OpenSharedResource(sharedHandle, __uuidof(ID3D11Resource), (void**)(&amp;tempResource11)); 	
            tempResource11-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(ID3D11Texture2D), (void**)(&amp;pTex2D_11)); 	
            tempResource11-&gt;Release(); 	
            // now use pTex2D_11 with pDevice11    </code>	
            	
             Textures being shared from D3D9 to D3D11 have the following restrictions.  Textures must be 2D Only 1 mip level is allowed Texture must have default usage Texture must be write only MSAA textures are not allowed Bind flags must have SHADER_RESOURCE and RENDER_TARGET set Only R10G10B10A2_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_FLOAT and R8G8B8A8_UNORM formats are allowed  If a shared texture is updated on one device <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Flush"/> must be called on that device.

            <remarks>	
            When multisampling a texture, the number of quality levels available for an adapter is dependent on the texture format used and the number of  samples requested. The maximum number of quality levels is defined by D3D11_MAX_MULTISAMPLE_SAMPLE_COUNT in D3D11.h. If this method returns 0, the format  and sample count combination is not supported for the installed adapter. Furthermore, the definition of a quality level is up to each hardware vendor to define, however no facility is provided by Direct3D to help discover  this information. Note that FEATURE_LEVEL_10_1 devices are required to support 4x MSAA for all render targets except R32G32B32A32 and R32G32B32. FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0 devices are required to support 4x MSAA for all render target formats, and 8x MSAA for all render target formats  except R32G32B32A32 formats.

            The data stored in the device with this method can be retrieved with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.GetPrivateData(System.Guid,System.Int32@,System.IntPtr)"/>. The data and guid set with this method will typically be application-defined. If an application uses this method to change the device type using GUID_DeviceType, results are undefined. However, GUID_DeviceType can be used to retrieve the device type using <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.GetPrivateData(System.Guid,System.Int32@,System.IntPtr)"/>. The {{debug layer}} reports memory leaks by outputting a list of object interface references along with their friendly names. The default friendly name is "&lt;unnamed&gt;". You can set the friendly name so that you can determine if the corresponding object interface reference caused the leak. To set the friendly name, use the SetPrivateData method and the WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName GUID that is in D3Dcommon.h. For example, to give pContext a friendly name of My name, use the following code: 	
            <code> static const char c_szName[] = "My name";

            Set an exception-mode flag to elevate an error condition to a non-continuable exception.  Whenever an error occurs, a Direct3D device enters the DEVICEREMOVED state and if the appropriate exception flag has been set, an exception is raised. A raised exception is designed to terminate an application. Before termination, the last chance an application has to persist data is by using an UnhandledExceptionFilter (see {{Structured Exception Handling}}). In general, UnhandledExceptionFilters are leveraged to try to persist data when an application is crashing (to disk, for example). Any code that executes during an UnhandledExceptionFilter is not guaranteed to reliably execute (due to possible process corruption). Any data that the UnhandledExceptionFilter manages to persist, before the UnhandledExceptionFilter crashes again, should be treated as suspect, and therefore inspected by a new, non-corrupted process to see if it is usable.

            <remarks>	
            This method is unusual in that it causes the GPU to perform the copy operation (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a result, it has a few restrictions designed for improving performance. For instance, the source and destination resources:  Must be different resources. Must be the same type. Must have identical dimensions (including width, height, depth, and size as appropriate). Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible DXGI formats, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. Might not be currently mapped.  You cannot use an {{Immutable}} resource as a destination. You can use a   {{depth-stencil}} resource as either a source or a destination.  Resources created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/>) can be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if one is multisampled and the other is not multisampled the call to ID3D11DeviceContext::CopyResource fails. The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data.  An application that only needs to copy a portion of the data in a resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})"/> instead.

            Copy a region from a source resource to a destination resource.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The source box must be within the size of the source resource. The destination offsets, (x, y, and z) allow the source box to be offset when writing into the destination resource; however, the dimensions of the source box and the offsets must be within the size of the resource. If the resources are buffers, all coordinates are in bytes; if the resources are textures, all coordinates are in texels. {{D3D11CalcSubresource}} is a helper function for calculating subresource indexes. CopySubresourceRegion performs the copy on the GPU (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a consequence, the source and destination resources:  Must be different subresources (although they can be from the same resource). Must be the same type. Must have compatible DXGI formats (identical or from the same type group). For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. May not be currently mapped.  CopySubresourceRegion only supports copy; it does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. An application that needs to copy an entire resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/> instead. CopySubresourceRegion is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue, this attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. See performance considerations for more details. Note??If you use CopySubresourceRegion with a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled resource, you must copy the whole subresource. In this situation, you must pass 0 to the DstX, DstY, and DstZ parameters and NULL to the pSrcBox parameter. In addition, source and destination resources, which are represented by the pSrcResource and pDstResource parameters, should have identical sample count values. Example The following code snippet copies a box (located at (120,100),(200,220)) from a source texture into a reqion (10,20),(90,140) in a destination texture. 	
            <code> D3D11_BOX sourceRegion;	
            sourceRegion.left = 120;	
            sourceRegion.right = 200;	
            sourceRegion.top = 100;	
            sourceRegion.bottom = 220;	
            sourceRegion.front = 0;	
            sourceRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;CopySubresourceRegion( pDestTexture, 0, 10, 20, 0, pSourceTexture, 0, &amp;sourceRegion ); </code>	
            	
             Notice, that for a 2D texture, front and back are set to 0 and 1 respectively.

            This API is most useful when re-using the resulting rendertarget of one render pass as an input to a second render pass. The source and destination resources must be the same resource type and have the same dimensions. In addition, they must have compatible formats. There are three scenarios for this:  ScenarioRequirements Source and destination are prestructured and typedBoth the source and destination must have identical formats and that format must be specified in the Format parameter. One resource is prestructured and typed and the other is prestructured and typelessThe typed resource must have a format that is compatible with the typeless resource (i.e. the typed resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT and the typeless resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS). The format of the typed resource must be specified in the Format parameter. Source and destination are prestructured and typelessBoth the source and desintation must have the same typeless format (i.e. both must have DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS), and the Format parameter must specify a format that is compatible with the source and destination (i.e. if both are DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS then DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT could be specified in the Format parameter). For example, given the DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_TYPELESS format:  The source (or dest) format could be DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_UNORM The dest (or source) format could be DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_FLOAT    ?

            A draw API submits work to the rendering pipeline. Instancing may extend performance by reusing the same geometry to draw multiple objects in a scene. One example of instancing could be  to draw the same object with different positions and colors. The vertex data for an instanced draw call normally comes from a vertex buffer that is bound to the pipeline.  However, you could also provide the vertex data from a shader that has instanced data identified with a system-value semantic (SV_InstanceID).

            The predicate must be in the "issued" or "signaled" state to be used for predication.

However, some Predicates are only hints, so they may not actually prevent operations from being performed.  The primary usefulness of Predication is to allow an application to issue graphics commands without taking the performance hit of spinning, waiting for <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> to return. So, Predication can occur while ID3D11DeviceContext::GetData returns S_FALSE. Another way to think of it: an application can also use Predication as a fallback, if it is possible that ID3D11DeviceContext::GetData returns S_FALSE. If ID3D11DeviceContext::GetData returns S_OK, the application can skip calling the graphics commands manually with it's own application logic.

            <remarks>	
            A draw API submits work to the rendering pipeline. This API submits work of an unknown size that was processed by the input assembler, vertex shader, and stream-output stages;  the work may or may not have gone through the geometry-shader stage. After data has been streamed out to stream-output stage buffers, those buffers can be again bound to the Input Assembler stage at input slot 0 and DrawAuto will draw them without the application needing to know the amount of data that was written to the buffers. A measurement of the amount of data written to the SO stage buffers is maintained internally when the data is streamed out. This means that the CPU does not need to fetch the measurement before re-binding the data that was streamed as input data. Although this amount is tracked internally, it is still the responsibility of applications to use input layouts to describe the format of the data in the SO stage buffers so that the layouts are available when the buffers are again bound to the input assembler. The following diagram shows the DrawAuto process.  ?  Diagram of DrawAuto as data moves through several stages to a buffer and then back to the Input Assembler stage ? Calling DrawAuto does not change the state of the streaming-output buffers that were bound again as inputs. DrawAuto only works when drawing with one input buffer bound as an input to the IA stage at slot 0. Applications must create the SO buffer resource with both binding flags, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.VertexBuffer"/> and D3D11_BIND_STREAM_OUTPUT. This API does not support indexing or instancing. If an application needs to retrieve the size of the streaming-output buffer, it can query for statistics on streaming output by using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryType.StreamOutputStatistics"/>.

            <remarks>	
            The source box must be within the size of the source resource. The destination offsets, (x, y, and z) allow the source box to be offset when writing into the destination resource; however, the dimensions of the source box and the offsets must be within the size of the resource. If the resources are buffers, all coordinates are in bytes; if the resources are textures, all coordinates are in texels. {{D3D11CalcSubresource}} is a helper function for calculating subresource indexes. CopySubresourceRegion performs the copy on the GPU (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a consequence, the source and destination resources:  Must be different subresources (although they can be from the same resource). Must be the same type. Must have compatible DXGI formats (identical or from the same type group). For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. May not be currently mapped.  CopySubresourceRegion only supports copy; it does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. An application that needs to copy an entire resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/> instead. CopySubresourceRegion is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue, this attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. See performance considerations for more details. Note??If you use CopySubresourceRegion with a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled resource, you must copy the whole subresource. In this situation, you must pass 0 to the DstX, DstY, and DstZ parameters and NULL to the pSrcBox parameter. In addition, source and destination resources, which are represented by the pSrcResource and pDstResource parameters, should have identical sample count values. Example The following code snippet copies a box (located at (120,100),(200,220)) from a source texture into a reqion (10,20),(90,140) in a destination texture. 	
            <code> D3D11_BOX sourceRegion;

            This method is unusual in that it causes the GPU to perform the copy operation (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a result, it has a few restrictions designed for improving performance. For instance, the source and destination resources:  Must be different resources. Must be the same type. Must have identical dimensions (including width, height, depth, and size as appropriate). Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible DXGI formats, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. Might not be currently mapped.  You cannot use an {{Immutable}} resource as a destination. You can use a   {{depth-stencil}} resource as either a source or a destination.  Resources created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/>) can be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if one is multisampled and the other is not multisampled the call to ID3D11DeviceContext::CopyResource fails. The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data.

            <remarks>	
            For a shader-constant buffer; set pDstBox to NULL. It is not possible to use this method to partially update a shader-constant buffer. A resource cannot be used as a destination if:  the resource is created with {{immutable}} usage. the resource is created as a depth-stencil resource. the resource is created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/>).  When UpdateSubresource returns, the application is free to change or even free the data pointed to by pSrcData because the method has already copied/snapped away the original contents. The performance of UpdateSubresource depends on whether or not there is contention for the destination resource. For example, contention for a vertex buffer resource occurs when the application executes a Draw call and later calls UpdateSubresource on the same vertex buffer before the Draw call is actually executed by the GPU.  When there is contention for the resource, UpdateSubresource will perform 2 copies of the source data. First, the data is copied by the CPU to a temporary storage space accessible by the command buffer. This copy happens before the method returns.  A second copy is then performed by the GPU to copy the source data into non-mappable memory. This second copy happens asynchronously because it is executed by GPU when the command buffer is flushed. When there is no resource contention, the behavior of UpdateSubresource is dependent on which is faster (from the CPU's perspective): copying the data to the command buffer and then having a second copy execute when the command buffer is flushed, or having the CPU copy the data to the final resource location. This is dependent on the architecture of the underlying system.  To better understand the source row pitch and source depth pitch parameters, the following illustration shows a 3D volume texture.  ?  Illustration of a 3D volume texture ? Each block in this visual represents an element of data, and the size of each element is dependent on the resource's format. For example, if the resource format is DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_FLOAT, the size of each element would be 128 bits, or 16 bytes. This 3D volume texture has a width of two, a height of three, and a depth of four. To calculate the source row pitch and source depth pitch for a given resource, use the following formulas:  Source Row Pitch = [size of one element in bytes] * [number of elements in one row] Source Depth Pitch = [Source Row Pitch] * [number of rows (height)]  In the case of this example 3D volume texture where the size of each element is 16 bytes, the formulas are as follows:  Source Row Pitch = 16 * 2 = 32 Source Depth Pitch = 16 * 2 * 3 = 96  The following illustration shows the resource as it is laid out in memory.  ?  Illustration of a 3D volume texture laid out in memory ? For example, the following code snippet shows how to specify a destination region in a 2D texture. Assume the destination texture is 512x512 and the operation will copy the data pointed to by pData to  [(120,100)..(200,220)] in the destination texture. Also assume that rowPitch has been initialized with the proper value (as explained above). front and back are set to 0 and 1 respectively, because by having front equal to back, the box is technically empty. 	
            <code> D3D11_BOX destRegion;	
            destRegion.left = 120;	
            destRegion.right = 200;	
            destRegion.top = 100;	
            destRegion.bottom = 220;	
            destRegion.front = 0;	
            destRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;UpdateSubresource( pDestTexture, 0, &amp;destRegion, pData, rowPitch, 0 ); </code>	
            	
             The 1D case is similar. The following snippet shows how to specify a destination region in a 1D texture. Use the same assumptions as above, except that the texture is 512 in length. 	
            <code> D3D11_BOX destRegion;	
            destRegion.left = 120	
            destRegion.right = 200;	
            destRegion.top = 0;	
            destRegion.bottom = 1;	
            destRegion.front = 0;	
            destRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;UpdateSubresource( pDestTexture, 0, &amp;destRegion, pData, rowPitch, 0 ); </code>	
            	
             Calling UpdateSubresource on a Deferred Context If your application calls UpdateSubresource on a deferred context with a destination box?to which pDstBox points?that has a non-(0,0,0) offset, where the driver does not support command lists, UpdateSubresource inappropriately applies that destination-box offset to the pSrcData parameter. To work around this behavior, use the following code: 	
            <code> HRESULT UpdateSubresource_Workaround( ID3D11Device *pDevice, ID3D11DeviceContext *pDeviceContext, ID3D11Resource *pDstResource, UINT dstSubresource, const D3D11_BOX *pDstBox, const void *pSrcData, UINT srcBytesPerElement, UINT srcRowPitch, UINT srcDepthPitch, bool* pDidWorkAround )

            To use a resource with SetResourceMinLOD, you must set the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.ResourceClamp"/> flag when you create that resource. For Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1, when sampling from a texture resource in a shader, the sampler can define a minimum LOD clamp to force sampling from less detailed mip levels.  For Direct3D 11, this functionality is extended from the sampler to the entire resource. Therefore, the application can specify the highest-resolution mip level of a resource that is available for access. This restricts the set of mip levels that are required to be resident in GPU memory, thereby saving memory. The set of mip levels resident per-resource in GPU memory can be specified by the user. Minimum LOD affects all of the resident mip levels. Therefore, only the resident mip levels can be updated and read from. All methods that access texture resources must adhere to minimum LOD clamps. Empty-set accesses are handled as out-of-bounds cases.

There are three scenarios for this:  ScenarioRequirements Source and destination are prestructured and typedBoth the source and destination must have identical formats and that format must be specified in the Format parameter. One resource is prestructured and typed and the other is prestructured and typelessThe typed resource must have a format that is compatible with the typeless resource (i.e. the typed resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT and the typeless resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS). The format of the typed resource must be specified in the Format parameter. Source and destination are prestructured and typelessBoth the source and desintation must have the same typeless format (i.e. both must have DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS), and the Format parameter must specify a format that is compatible with the source and destination (i.e. if both are DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS then DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT could be specified in the Format parameter).

            This method resets any device context to the default settings. This sets all input/output resource slots, shaders, input layouts, predications, scissor rectangles, depth-stencil state, rasterizer state, blend state, sampler state, and viewports to NULL. The primitive topology is set to UNDEFINED. For a scenario where you would like to clear a list of commands recorded so far, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.FinishCommandListInternal(System.Boolean,SharpDX.Direct3D11.CommandList@)"/> and throw away the resulting <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CommandList"/>.

            <remarks>	
            Most applications will not need to call this method. Calling this method when not necessary will incur a performance penalty.  Each call to Flush incurs a significant amount of overhead. When Direct3D state-setting, present, or draw commands are called by an application, those commands are queued into an internal command buffer.  Flush sends those commands to the GPU for processing. Normally, these commands are sent to the GPU automatically whenever Direct3D determines that  they need to be, such as when the command buffer is full or when mapping a resource. Flush will send the commands manually. Flush should be used when the CPU waits for an arbitrary amount of time (such as when  calling {{Sleep}}). Because Flush operates asynchronously,  it can return either before or after the GPU finishes executing the queued graphics commands. However, the graphics commands will eventually always complete. You can call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateQuery(SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryDescription,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Query@)"/> method with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryType.Event"/> value to create an event query; you can then use that event query in a call to the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> method to determine when the GPU is finished processing the graphics commands.	
             Direct3D11 defers the destruction of objects, an application cannot rely upon objects immediately being destroyed. Calling Flush will destroy any  objects whose destruction has been deferred.  If an application requires synchronous destruction of an object the application should release all its references, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState"/>, and then call Flush.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Create a command list from a deferred context and record commands into it by calling FinishCommandList. Play back a command list with an immediate context by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ExecuteCommandList(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CommandList,System.Boolean)"/>. Immediate context state is cleared before and after a command list is executed. A command list has no concept of inheritance. Each call to FinishCommandList will record only the state set since any previous call to  FinishCommandList. For example, the state of a {{device context}} is its render state or pipeline state. To retrieve device context state, an application can call  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/> or  <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetPredication(System.Boolean@)"/>. For more information about how to use FinishCommandList, see {{How to: Record a Command List}}.

            <param name="restoreDeferredContextState">A Boolean flag that determines whether the runtime saves deferred context state before it executes  FinishCommandList and restores it afterwards. Use TRUE to indicate that the runtime needs to save and restore the state. Use FALSE to indicate that the runtime will not save or restore any state. In this case, the deferred context will  return to its default state after the call to  FinishCommandList completes. Typically, use FALSE unless you restore the state to be nearly equivalent to the state that the runtime would restore if you passed TRUE. When you use FALSE, you can avoid unnecessary and inefficient state transitions. </param>

            Call ID3D10Device::SOSetTargets (before any draw calls) to stream data out; call SOSetTargets with NULL to stop streaming data out. For an example, see Exercise 01 from the GDC 2007 workshop, which sets the stream output rendertargets before calling draw methods in the RenderInstanceToStream function. An offset of -1 will cause the stream output buffer to be appended, continuing after the last location written to the buffer in a previous stream output pass. Calling this method using a buffer that is currently bound for writing will effectively bind NULL instead because a buffer cannot be bound as both an input and an output at the same time. The {{Debug Layer}} will generate a warning whenever a resource is prevented from being bound simultaneously as an input and an output, but this will not prevent invalid data from being used by the runtime. The method will not hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. For that reason, applications should be careful not to release an interface currently in use by the device.

Calling this method using a buffer that is currently bound for writing (i.e. bound to the stream output pipeline stage) will effectively bind NULL instead because a buffer cannot be bound as both an input and an output at the same time. The debug layer will generate a warning whenever a resource is prevented from being bound simultaneously as an input and an output, but this will not prevent invalid data from being used by the runtime.

            The maximum number of active render targets a device can have active at any given time is set by a #define in D3D11.h called  D3D11_SIMULTANEOUS_RENDER_TARGET_COUNT. It is invalid to try to set the same subresource to multiple render target slots.  Any render targets not defined by this call are set to NULL. If any subresources are also currently bound for reading in a different stage or writing (perhaps in a different part of the pipeline),  those bind points will be NULL'ed out to prevent the same subresource from being read and written simultaneously in a single rendering operation.  The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.  If the render-target views were created from an array resource type, then all of the render-target views must have the same array size.   This restriction also applies to the depth-stencil view, its array size must match that of the render-target views being bound.

            <remarks>	
            For pixel shaders, the render targets and unordered-access views share the same resource slots when being written out. This means that UAVs must be  given an offset so that they are placed in the slots after the render target views that are being bound.  Note??RTVs, DSV, and UAVs cannot be set independently; they all need to be set at the same time. Two RTVs conflict if they share a subresource (and therefore share the same resource). Two UAVs conflict if they share a subresource (and therefore share the same resource). An RTV conflicts with a UAV if they share a subresource or share a bind point. OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews operates properly in the following situations:   NumViews != D3D11_KEEP_RENDER_TARGETS_AND_DEPTH_STENCIL and NumUAVs != D3D11_KEEP_UNORDERED_ACCESS_VIEWS The following conditions must be true for OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews to succeed and for the runtime to pass the bind information to the driver:  NumViews &lt;= 8 UAVStartSlot &gt;= NumViews UAVStartSlot + NumUAVs &lt;= 8 There must be no conflicts in the set of all ppRenderTargetViews and ppUnorderedAccessView. ppDepthStencilView must match the render-target views. For more information about resource views, see {{Introduction to a Resource in Direct3D 11}}.  OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews performs the following tasks:  Unbinds all currently bound conflicting resources (stream-output target resources (SOTargets), compute shader (CS) UAVs, shader-resource views (SRVs)). Binds ppRenderTargetViews, ppDepthStencilView, and ppUnorderedAccessView.    NumViews == D3D11_KEEP_RENDER_TARGETS_AND_DEPTH_STENCIL  In this situation, OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews binds only UAVs.  The following conditions must be true for OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews to succeed and for the runtime to pass the bind information to the driver:  UAVStartSlot + NumUAVs &lt;= 8 There must be no conflicts in ppUnorderedAccessView.  OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews unbinds the following items:  All RTVs in slots &gt;= UAVStartSlot All RTVs that conflict with any UAVs in ppUnorderedAccessView All currently bound resources (SOTargets, CS UAVs, SRVs) that conflict with ppUnorderedAccessView  OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews binds ppUnorderedAccessView. OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews ignores ppDepthStencilView, and the current depth-stencil view remains bound.   NumUAVs == D3D11_KEEP_UNORDERED_ACCESS_VIEWS In this situation, OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews binds only RTVs and DSV.  The following conditions must be true for OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews to succeed and for the runtime to pass the bind information to the driver:  NumViews &lt;= 8 There must be no conflicts in ppRenderTargetViews. ppDepthStencilView must match the render-target views. For more information about resource views, see {{Introduction to a Resource in Direct3D 11}}.  OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews unbinds the following items:  All UAVs in slots &lt; NumViews All UAVs that conflict with any RTVs in ppRenderTargetViews All currently bound resources (SOTargets, CS UAVs, SRVs) that conflict with ppRenderTargetViews  OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews binds ppRenderTargetViews and ppDepthStencilView.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Blend state is used by the output-merger stage to determine how to blend together two pixel values. The two values are commonly the current pixel value and the pixel value already in the output render target. Use the {{blend operation}} to control where the two pixel values come from and how they are mathematically combined. To create a blend-state interface, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateBlendState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendStateDescription@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendState@)"/>. Passing in NULL for the blend-state interface indicates to the runtime to set a default blending state.  The following table indicates the default blending parameters.  StateDefault Value AlphaToCoverageEnableFALSE BlendEnableFALSE[8] SrcBlendD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD SrcBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpAlphaD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD RenderTargetWriteMask[8]D3D11_COLOR_WRITE_ENABLE_ALL[8]  ? A sample mask determines which samples get updated in all the active render targets. The mapping of bits in a sample mask to samples in a multisample render target is the responsibility of an individual application. A sample mask is always applied; it is independent of whether multisampling is enabled, and does not depend on whether an application uses multisample render targets.  The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.

            <remarks>	
            An application identifies the way a resource is intended to be used (its usage) in a resource description. There are several structures for creating resources including: <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1DDescription"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture3DDescription"/>, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BufferDescription"/>.   Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 10/11: In Direct3D 9, you specify the type of memory a resource should be created in at resource creation time (using D3DPOOL). It was an application's job to decide what memory pool would provide the best combination of functionality and performance. In Direct3D 10/11, an application no longer specifies what type of memory (the pool) to create a resource in. Instead, you specify the intended usage of the resource, and let the runtime (in concert with the driver and a memory manager) choose the type of memory that will achieve the best performance.   ? Resource Usage Restrictions Each usage dictates a tradeoff between functionality and performance. In general, resource accessing is accomplished with the following APIs.  CPU access is done with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Map(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MappedSubResource@)"/>. GPU access is done with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/>, or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource(SharpDX.DataBox,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)"/>.  Use the following table to choose the usage that best describes how the resource will need to be accessed by the CPU and/or the GPU. Of course, there will be performance tradeoffs.  Resource UsageDefaultDynamicImmutableStaging GPU-Readyesyes1yesyes1, 2 GPU-Writeyes1yes1, 2 CPU-Readyes1, 2 CPU-Writeyesyes1, 2  ?  1 - This is restricted to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyStructureCount(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.UnorderedAccessView)"/>. 2 - Cannot be a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled render target.  Resource Bind Options To maximize performance, not all resource usage options can be used as input or output resources to the pipeline. This table identifies these limitations.  Resource Can Be Bound AsDefaultDynamicImmutableStaging Input to a Stageyes3yes4yes Output from a Stageyes3  ?  3 - If bound as an input and an output using different views, each view must use different subresources. 4 - The resource can only be created with a single subresource. The resource cannot be a texture array. The resource cannot be a mipmap chain.

            <remarks>	
            In general, binding flags can be combined using a logical OR (except the constant-buffer flag); however, you should use a single flag to allow the device to optimize the resource usage. This enumeration is used by a:   {{Buffer description}} when creating a buffer. Texture description when creating a texture (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1DDescription"/> or <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/> or <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture3DDescription"/>).  A shader-resource buffer is NOT a constant buffer; rather, it is a texture or buffer resource that is bound to a shader, that contains texture or buffer data (it is not limited to a single element type in the buffer). A shader-resource buffer is created with the D3D11_BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE flag and is bound to the pipeline using one of these APIs: <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GeometryShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView[])"/>, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.PixelShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView[])"/>, or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.VertexShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView[])"/>. Furthermore, a shader-resource buffer cannot use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/> flag.

            This enumeration is used in <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Map(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MappedSubResource@)"/>. These remarks are divided into the following topics:   {{Meaning of D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE}} {{Common Usage of D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD with D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE}}  Meaning of D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE signifies that the application promises not to write to data that the input assembler (IA) stage is using. In exchange, the GPU allows the application to write to other parts of the same buffer.  The application must ensure that it does not write over any data in use by the IA stage. For example, consider the buffer illustrated in the following diagram. If a Draw call has been issued that uses vertices 4-6, then an application that calls Map on this buffer must ensure that it does not write to the vertices that the Draw call will access during rendering. ?  Diagram of a buffer that includes vertices in different stages of utilization ? However, ensuring this can be difficult, because the GPU is often many frames behind the CPU in terms of which frame it is currently processing. Keeping track of which sections of a resource are being used because of calls made 2 to 5 frames ago is difficult and error-prone. Because of this, it is recommended that applications only write to the uninitialized portions of a resource when using D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE. Common Usage of D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD with D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD and D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE are normally used in conjunction with dynamic index/vertex buffers. D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD can also be used with dynamic textures. However, D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE cannot be used with dynamic textures. A common use of these two flags involves filling dynamic index/vertex buffers with geometry that can be seen from the camera's current position. The first time that data is entered into the buffer on a given frame, Map is called with D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD; doing so invalidates the previous contents of the buffer. The buffer is then filled with all available data. Subsequent writes to the buffer within the same frame should use D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE. This will enable the CPU to access a resource that is potentially being used by the GPU as long as the restrictions described previously are respected.

            The runtime implements RGB blending and alpha blending separately. Therefore, blend state requires separate blend operations for RGB data and alpha data.

The two sources?Source 1, called SrcBlend and SrcBlendAlpha, and Source 2, called DestBlend and DestBlendAlpha?are shown in the blending block diagram.

Point sampling reads a single texel while linear sampling reads two texels (endpoints) and linearly interpolates a third value between the endpoints. HLSL texture-sampling functions also support comparison filtering during texture sampling. Comparison filtering compares each sampled texel against a comparison value. The boolean result is blended the same way that normal texture filtering is blended. You can use HLSL intrinsic texture-sampling functions that implement texture filtering only or companion functions that use texture filtering with comparison filtering.  Texture Sampling FunctionTexture Sampling Function with Comparison Filtering samplesamplecmp or samplecmplevelzero  ? Comparison filters only work with textures that have the following DXGI formats: R32_FLOAT_X8X24_TYPELESS, R32_FLOAT, R24_UNORM_X8_TYPELESS, R16_UNORM.

An application might dynamically create (and destroy) threads to improve performance especially on a machine with multiple CPU cores. There may be cases, however, when an application needs to prevent extra threads from being created. This can happen when you want to simplify debugging, profile code or develop a tool for instance. For these cases, use D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_PREVENT_INTERNAL_THREADING_OPTIMIZATIONS to request that the runtime and video driver not create any additional threads that might interfere with the application.

            D3DX11 automatically performs gamma correction (to convert color data from RGB space to standard RGB space) when loading texture data. This is automatically done for instance when RGB data is loaded from a .png file into an sRGB texture. Use the SRGB filter flags to indicate if the data does not need to be converted into sRGB space.

            <remarks>	
            This entry-point is supported by the Direct3D 11 runtime, which is available on Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and as an update to  Windows Vista (KB971644). Set ppDevice and ppImmediateContext to NULL to determine which feature level is supported by looking  at pFeatureLevel without creating a device. For an example, see {{How To: Create a Device and Immediate Context}}; to create a device and a swap chain at the same time,  use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDeviceAndSwapChain(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription@,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device@,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/>. If you set the pAdapter parameter to a non-NULL value, you must also set the DriverType parameter to the D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_UNKNOWN value. If you set the pAdapter parameter to a non-NULL value and the DriverType parameter to the D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_HARDWARE value, D3D11CreateDevice returns an <see cref="T:System.Int32"/> of E_INVALIDARG.   Differences between Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11: In Direct3D 10, the presence of pAdapter dictated which adapter to use and the DriverType could  mismatch what the adapter was. In Direct3D 11, if you are trying to create a hardware or a software device, set pAdapter != NULL which constrains  the other inputs to be:  DriverType must be D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_UNKNOWN Software must be NULL.  On the other hand, if pAdapter == NULL, the DriverType cannot be set to D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_UNKNOWN; it can be set to either:  If DriverType == D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_SOFTWARE,  Software cannot be NULL. If DriverType == D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_HARDWARE, the adapter used will be the default adapter, which is the first adapter that is enumerated by {{IDXGIFactory1::EnumAdapters}}     ?

            <remarks>	
            This entry-point is supported by the Direct3D 11 runtime, which is available on Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and as an update to  Windows Vista (KB971644). Also, see the remarks section in <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device@,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/> for details about input parameter dependencies. To create a device without  creating a swap chain, use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device@,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/> function.  If you set the pAdapter parameter to a non-NULL value, you must also set the DriverType parameter to the D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_UNKNOWN value. If you set the pAdapter parameter to a non-NULL value and the DriverType parameter to the D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_HARDWARE value, D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain returns an <see cref="T:System.Int32"/> of E_INVALIDARG.

            This method does not remove any messages from the message queue. This method gets messages from the message queue after an optional retrieval filter has been applied. Applications should call this method twice to retrieve a message - first to obtain the size of the message and second to get the message. Here is a typical example: 	
            <code> // Get the size of the message	
            SIZE_T messageLength = 0;	
            HRESULT hr = pInfoQueue-&gt;GetMessage(0, NULL, &amp;messageLength); // Allocate space and get the message	
            D3D11_MESSAGE * pMessage = (D3D11_MESSAGE*)malloc(messageLength);	
            hr = pInfoQueue-&gt;GetMessage(0, pMessage, &amp;messageLength); </code>

If the resource being created does not require a system-memory pitch or a system-memory-pitch  slice, then you are free to use those members to pass size information which may help you when debugging a problem creating a resource. Note that an application should not rely on SysMemPitch being exactly equal to the number of texels in a line times the size of a texel. In some cases SysMemPitch will include padding to skip past additional data in a line.  This could be padding for alignment or  the texture could be a subsection of a larger texture.  For example the D3D11_SUBRESOURCE_DATA structure could represent a 32 by 32 subsection of a 128 by 128 texture.   The value for SysMemSlicePitch will reflect any padding included in SysMemPitch.

            <remarks>	
            A view is a format-specific way to look at the data in a resource. The view determines what data to look at, and how it is cast when read. When viewing a resource, the resource-view description must specify a typed format, that is compatible with the resource format. So that means that you cannot create a resource-view description using any format with _TYPELESS in the name. You can however view a typeless resource by specifying a typed format for the view. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS resource can be viewed with one of these typed formats: DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT, DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT, and DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_SINT, since these typed formats are compatible with the typeless resource. Create a shader-resource-view description by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateShaderResourceView(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription},SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView@)"/>. To view a shader-resource-view description, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView.GetDescription(SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription@)"/>.

            When initializing the structure, you may set any member to D3DX11_DEFAULT and D3DX will initialize it with a default value from the source texture when the texture is loaded. This structure can be used by APIs that:  Create resources, such as {{D3DX11CreateTextureFromFile}} and {{D3DX11CreateShaderResourceViewFromFile}}. Create data processors, such as {{D3DX11CreateAsyncTextureInfoProcessor}} or	
            {{D3DX11CreateAsyncShaderResourceViewProcessor}}.  The default values are: 	
            <code> Width = D3DX11_DEFAULT; Height = D3DX11_DEFAULT; Depth = D3DX11_DEFAULT; FirstMipLevel = D3DX11_DEFAULT; MipLevels = D3DX11_DEFAULT; Usage = (D3D11_USAGE) D3DX11_DEFAULT; BindFlags = D3DX11_DEFAULT; CpuAccessFlags = D3DX11_DEFAULT; MiscFlags = D3DX11_DEFAULT; Format = DXGI_FORMAT_FROM_FILE; Filter = D3DX11_DEFAULT; MipFilter = D3DX11_DEFAULT; pSrcInfo = NULL; </code>	
            	
             Here is a brief example that uses this structure to supply the pixel format when loading a texture. For the complete code, see HDRFormats10.cpp in {{HDRToneMappingCS11 Sample}}.
